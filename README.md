Role of PRC government in facilitating Tariffs and Sanction Evasions
Over the past decade China has grown to become industrial leader of the world. For a brief comparison in year in year 2000 China export were around $233bn which increased 10 fold  to $2trillion in year 2012. Fast forward today China exports 3.7 trillion worth of goods.[23].With increase in GDP and exports Chinese fortune 500  companies also increased from form 10 to 136 in 2022- even highest by US. Revenue by Chinese companies reached 11 Trillian dollars matching that of US and bypassing Japan, Germany, France and UK.[24] As a party state China regional and national governments has established tight control of how much economy it can privatize and by what measures. Out of 136 SOE 71% are State-Backed Enterprises accounting for 78% of total profit. More importantly just 54 SOE account for 70% of all the assets held by Chinese companies.
 
3.1 State Sponsored Credits, tax rebates and Subsidies By People Republic of China 
Chinese government has been long accused of incentivising local, state-owned enterprises by providing them R & D subsidies, tax breaks and access to cheap below the market credit. While how much of this is true is debatable, however according to a report subsidy received by Chinese multinationals has increased 7-fold from 4 billion in year 2007 to 29 billion in year 2018. This amount has increased further and according to a report by Keir institute of Germany, in the year 2023 [23] around 5000 Chinese listed companies received a total subsidies of approximately 34 billion dollars. World trade organisation has prohibited subsidies in certain sectors, so to make sure that current Chinese level and method of subsidies avoid WTO rules, PRC has given tax rebates as an alternative to subsidies. Alternatively, when compared to American and German automakers Chinese automakers have privilege of cheap credit and in comparison, to others their cost to equity is lowest among peers. This has decreased the cost of manufacturing and provided an edge to Chinese automakers. Further,recently China has ramped up

In late 2022 Chinese government has decided to dedicate its resources only for handful of chip companies and has eliminated their performance based goal for grants and benefits. To achieve a breakthrough Chinese government will subsidise them without any funding gap. Someone of the companies in the list includes Huawei, Naura, SMIC, and Advanced Mirco fabrication Inc.[33]
These research subsides were meant to increase export of Chinese firms, impact the purpose was to increase their competitiveness both at home and abroad [25].    [24]
 
Most importantly enterprises where state holds minority stakes are more likely to receive subsidy receipts rather than private owned firms. [23]

3.2 State Backed Funds Investing and Buying Critical Sector Companies and Theft
Currently, China has approximately 1600+ active state guided investment funds with total capital exceeding 600 billion dollars. These state guided funds play a major role in investing in critical and lead technology sectors. Domestically, these funds aim to drive competition and make sure Chinese companies maintain an financial and industrial edge over foreign firms operating elsewhere. Additionally, according to an analysis by Australia Strategic Policy Institute China currently leads in 57 of the critical technology out of 64 edging out US which leads in just seven.[45]Yet the lead has not comes solely from the research and innovation of Chinese researchers, industries, universities as Chinese authorities CCP members and government offices try to say. On the contrary, Chinese manufactures over years acquired western technologies which China has acquired by paying a hefty amount, forced foreign firms to transfer intellectual property over the years. 
To pursue the goal Chinese companies and local government employs complex investment structures, often with the backing of state-controlled funds, to acquire foreign companies. But due to western restrictions and counter surveillance Chinese investments and venture capital in US, Europe and UK has fallen to decade low. But, despite heightened scrutiny and regulations from the U.S. government, these funds were able to continue and pursue investments in high technology companies. Two examples involve CICFâ€™s (National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund) investments in Pixelworks and Black Sesame Technologies, both U.S. semiconductor companies. Pixelworks specializes in video- and pixel-processing semiconductors, while Black Sesame Technologies focuses on AI chips used in vehicle navigation and safety.[24][26][34] [56]. 
In a similar steps Chinese companies have gone for acquisition spree , often backed by state-controlled funds. A notable example is the acquisition of Swedish MEMS manufacturer Silex Microsystems by the Chinese company NavTech67. The acquisition, facilitated by a network of investment holding companies involving Chinese state-controlled funds, raised concerns about the transfer of sensitive microchip technology that could benefit the Chinese military.[25]These cases illustrate how Chinese state-backed funds utilize intricate investment strategies to gain access to critical technologies, even amid increased scrutiny from U.S. and E.U. authorities. However, concerns persist that Chinese investors might still exploit joint ventures and minority stakes to gain access to sensitive technologies. 

.As Western Lawmakers become aware of Chinese activities they rush to block acquisition and transfer of critical technologies[34].
